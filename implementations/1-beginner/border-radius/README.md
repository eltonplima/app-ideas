The property -moz-border-radius was [removed](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius\)

From official documentation, link above:

> In Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 / Thunderbird 3.3 / SeaMonkey 2.1) **-moz-border-radius was renamed to border-radius; -moz-border-radius was supported as an alias until Gecko 12.0 (Firefox 12.0 / Thunderbird 12.0 / SeaMonkey 2.9).** In order to conform to the CSS3 standard, Gecko 2.0 changes the handling of <percentage> values to match the specification. You can specify an ellipse as border on an arbitrary sized element just with border-radius: 50%;. Gecko 2.0 also makes rounded corners clip content and images (if overflow: visible is not set)
